EcoLog is a full-stack web application that empowers both individuals and corporates to log their eco-friendly actions and visualize their collective environmental impact. The platform translates sustainable choices—such as energy saving, recycling, upcycling, and sustainable commuting—into measurable metrics like CO₂ reduction, water savings, and waste diverted from landfills.

Individuals earn EcoPoints for each verified action, which can be redeemed for discounts and offers from sustainable brands under our Corporate Membership Program. Corporates gain access to an impact dashboard that aggregates employee data, generates sustainability reports, and helps design internal eco-incentive programs.

A supporting feature, the Offline AI Analyzer, allows users to upload images of unused items. The AI classifies whether an item can be recycled or upcycled, and provides tailored suggestions on how and where it can be reused—promoting a circular economy within the app.
